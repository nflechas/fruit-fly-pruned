# Hashing pruned embeddings:

This is the accompanying code for an experiment for hashing pruned and unpruned GloVe word embeddings using a fruit-fly-derived hashing algorithm. It is based on the repository https://github.com/ml-for-nlp/fruit-fly. To run it, use :

    python3 pruned_fly_solution_pca.py --matrix_type=pruned --num_cat=2
